<h1>Vector database for your RAG?</h1>
<p>In the realm of data management and search technology, vector databases are an emerging technology that are designed to handle complex data and enable efficient similarity and semantic searches. Here's a concise guide to understanding vector databases and their applications.</p>
<h3>What is a Vector Database?</h3>
<p></p>Vector databases is a type of database designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently.Unlike traditional databases that organize data in rows and columns, vector databases work with data represented as vectors. These vectors are numerical representations of various types of data, such as text, images, or audio.

<h3>Key Concepts in Vector Databases</h3>
<li><strong>Vector Embedding : </strong>Vector embeddings are mathematical representation of data. These are produced using a pretrained model called Embedding model, which is basically a neural network model with output layer being removed. One of the common examples of embedding model are word2vec, which is used for text based tasks. </li>
<li><strong>Semantic search : </strong> Semantic search refers to search my meaning. Unlike keyword based searches, semantic search uses NLP(Natural  langauge processing) techniques to search by contextual meaning.</li>
<h3>How does Vector databases work ? </h3>
